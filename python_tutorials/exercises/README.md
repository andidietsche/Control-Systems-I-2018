## README
The exercise summary has been moved to an [**Overleaf**](https://www.overleaf.com/) shared project.
All ETH members have free access to Overleaf, a web latex editor. It is very useful 
when working as a team on the same documentation. It supports commenting and 
 history logs. 

You can open an account using your ETH credentials [here](https://www.overleaf.com/).
You can edit, view and contribute to the exercise summary, clicking on the following link: https://v2.overleaf.com/6136368133vsxwdhrxfbbj

We will keep on the github page, the most updated version of the Summary.
